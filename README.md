• Developed a machine learning model to classify SMS messages into “Ham” or “Spam” categories
classify. A feature called “Predict Message” has been implemented to predict the probability of
Evaluate messages and categorize them as “ham” or “spam”.
• Used TensorFlow, Matplotlib, NumPy and Pandas for model development, problem solving and analysis
• Use of the SMS spam collection data set, pre-grouped into training and test data, for training and
Validation. The model returns a list containing the probability value (between 0 and 1) for each
message and the corresponding classification (“ham” or “spam”).
• Tools and technologies TensorFlow 2.0, Keras, Convolutional Neural Network, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Deep
